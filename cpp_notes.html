    1.  ostream& operator<<(ostream& os, pt p) {
        return os << "("<< p.x << "," << p.y << ")";
        }
        Some example usage:
        pt a{3,4}, b{2,-1};
        cout << a+b << " " << a-b << "\n"; // (5,3) (1,5)
        cout << a*-1 << " " << b/2 << "\n"; // (-3,-4) (1.5,2)

        side note: we have to define the function as a global function.
                   and if we want to use the private member of a object we have to define the
                   function in the class body with friend attribute and then define the function
                   globally.
